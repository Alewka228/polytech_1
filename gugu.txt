Guess what, I've got a fever
And the only prescription is more cowbell
Couldn't leave here without this one now could we?
We're not gonna take it
Oh no, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose it
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just
Don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
We're not gonna take it
Oh no, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
Oh, you're so condescending
Your gall is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
Boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do
Sing it
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
No way
Yeah
Sing it
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see
Sing it for me, Jersey
We're not gonna take it (come on)
No, we ain't gonna take it (louder)
We're not gonna take it anymore
We're not gonna take it
Oh no, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
Sing it, sing it, sing
We're not gonna take it (louder)
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
One more, one more, one more
We're not gonna take it (what)
No, we ain't gonna take it (yeah)
We're not gonna take it anymore
And don't you take it either...
